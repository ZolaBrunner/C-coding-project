## Project Overview
This project showcases a Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm written in **C++** that shifts letters in a message by a given number of positions in the alphabet. The goal is to send secret messages using a Halloween theme, adding a fun and spooky touch to the classic cipher.

## Features
- 🛠 **Encrypt and Decrypt Messages**: Encode or decode your secret message with Caesar Cipher by providing a shift value.
- 🎃 **Halloween-Themed UI**: User interface with spooky Halloween characters like vampires and witches to enhance user experience.
- 📜 **Shift Letters or Keep Non-Letters**: Shifts letters only, while keeping numbers, spaces, and punctuation unchanged.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Encryption and Decryption**: Enter a message and instantly see the encrypted or decrypted result.
